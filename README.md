# Music Data Analysis

This project performs various analyses on a list of music artists, focusing on their release dates, genres, and sales figures. The data is managed through a `Data` class that includes properties such as artist name, genre, release date, and copies sold. The analyses are carried out using LINQ queries to filter, group, and select specific data.

## Code Overview

The code consists of several LINQ queries to achieve the following goals:

1. **Artists Starting with 'S'**
2. **Artists with Sales Above 10 Million**
3. **Pop Music After the Year 2000**
4. **Artist with the Most Sales**
5. **Oldest Artist**
6. **Newest Artist**
